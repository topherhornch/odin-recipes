        <p>There's nothing better than waking up in the morning with your favorite beverage. I personally love to wake up to a fresh brewed cappuchino complete with some steamed conconut milk! The only thing that makes it better is a fresh baked muffin!</p>

        <p>When I'm on the go these muffins do the trick! The rich robust flavor of your favorite coffee and the sweet gooey chocolate moresels spread through out! Bake these off the night before and pop them in the mircrowave for warm sweet treat in the morning!</p>

        <p>Now i love Chocolate chip muffins and double chocole chip muffins but the idea of combining the favor of my favorite brand of coffe with a moist cake and chocolate chips just started making my mouth water.</p>

        <p>So I got to work doctoring my basic muffin base recipe and these Cappuccino Chocolate Chip Muffins are the result! Making them bakery style meant a few things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The muffins have to be gigantic</li>
            <li>They have to be slightly more cake like texture</li>
            <li>They had to have the sky high, perfectly domed muffin tops</li>
            <li>There coudl be no skimping on chocolate chips</li>
        </ol>
