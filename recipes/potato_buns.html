        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For uniform buns, use a scale to weigh them. before shaping weigh the dough and divide it by 9 for large buns, 10-12 for medium buns or 14 to 16 for slider buns.</li>
            <li>Apply the egg wash very gently to avoid deflating the Buns</li>
            <li>Store the buns in a resealable food storage bag and store them at room temperature for up to 4-5 days.</li>
        </ul>
