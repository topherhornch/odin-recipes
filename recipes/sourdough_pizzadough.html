        <p>There are only a few steps standing between you and sourdough pizza crust bliss. Let's get started with the starter!</p>

        <img src="../images/sourdough-pizza/sourdough-starter.jpg" alt="picture of a scale and sourdough starter in a jar" width="400">

        <h2>Sourdough Starter</h2>
        <p>Sourdough starter is simple to make and maintain. Using two ingredients you while letting nature do the work. A natural fermentation process takes a mixture of wholewheat and all-purpose flour and water to creat natural yeast. Using this natural yeast gives any dough made with this starter a unique flavor</p>

        <h3>You will need to grab a couple things:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Glass jar w/o the lid</li>
            <li>Bowl to mix the starter</li>
            <li>Rubber scrapper</li>
            <li>Air tight container</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>3 Cups Whole Wheat Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Water (Bottled or Distilled)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step by Step guide to sourdough starter</h4>
        <p>You'll feed the starter everyday around the same time, so chose morning or evening depending on what is most convinient to your schedule in order to stay consistent.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix Four Mixture</li>
            <p>Mix the all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour until well combined and store in your air tight container. You will use this flour to feed your starter throughout the process.</p>
            <li>Day 1: Mix the Four and Water</li>
            <p>Start by mixing 1 Cup of the four mixture with 1/2 cup of the bottled or distilled water. Use the rubber scraper to scrape the starter into the galss jar and cover with plastic film using the rubber band to keep the film in place. I like to mark the level of the starter on the side of a jar with a marker to keep track of the activity of the starter.</p> 
            <p>A note on mixing the starter with your hands. Starter relies on ambient bacteria to help break down the wheat creating sugar from the starch and the natural yeast present in the yeast breaks down the sugar and creates carbon dioxide to aid in the rising of the bread. The human body is covered in bacteria. This added bacteria will aid in the unique flavor of the dough. So roll up those sleves and get your hands dirty!</p>
            <li>Day 2: Stir</li>
            <p>Wait 24 hours, then check the mixture. Give it a stir to help incorporate a little air.</p>
            <p>You should notice some initial bubbling or signs of activity</p>
            <li>Day 3 - 7 Discard and Feed Daily Until Active</li>
            <p>Starting on day three you will discard most of the starter in the jar and feed it with your flour and water.</p>
            <p>Once a day around the same time discard all but 1/4 cup of starter from the jar and feed it with 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of water (distilled or bottled)</p>
            <p>Repeat this daily, discarding and feeding until your starter becomes active, bubbly, and doubles in size after each feeding. At this point your sourdough starter is ready to use in recipes.</p>
        </ol>

        </ol>
       

        <h4>The next morning</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform a set of strecth and folds. Wet your hand with water to prevent the dough from sticking. While the dough is still in the bowl gently pull one side of the dough up and over itself. Turn the bowl and repeat this on all sides of the dough until you turned the bowl full circle.</li>

            <img src="../images/sourdough-pizza/sourdough-pizza-mixing-starter.jpg" alt="Mixing the sourdough pizza dough" width="400">

            <li>Cover the bowl and place in the fridge, up to 36 hours until ready to bake. (The dough can be used at this point to make your pizza, the cold ferment is optional.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>That Night</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the dough and let rest on the counter for 30 minutes to come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and on a generously floured work surface, shape each portion into bal shape. Cover the mounds with a tea towel let rest 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <img src="../images/sourdough-pizza/sourdough-pizza-covering-dough-balls.jpg" alt="four dough balls being covered with a tea towel on a floured work surface"   width="400">

            <li>Turn on your oven's broiler to heat a cast iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat. While the skillet is preaheating, use your hands to press a ball of dough into an 8" circle. On a floured surface. Use more flour as needed to prevent from sticking. <em>(If you find the dough difficult to shape into a piza crust, let it rest on the counter for 15 minutes in order for the cluten to relax.)</em></li>

            <li>When the Skillet is hot, lay the circle of dough onto the skillet. Immediately place the sauce and toppings on the crust and cook for 5-6 minutes or until the bottom of the curst is starting to char.</li>
